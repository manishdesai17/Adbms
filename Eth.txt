1. What’s the Project?
This project is a web application to manage hackathons, allowing users to register, admins to organize events, and judges to evaluate projects.
2. What I Did
•	Finished backend for user side (registration, team formation, Add hackathon). 
•	Completed backend for admin side (Show all hackathons, show all teams, Show winner team, Send pass email, Send certificate email). 
•	Finished backend for judge side (project evaluation, select teams, select win teams). 
•	Completed frontend for user side (pages like View all hackathon, view hackathon, registration).
3. What I’m Doing Now
•	Starting frontend for user side (in progress). 
•	Starting frontend for judge side (in progress).
•	Starting frontend for admin side (in progress).
4. Problems
•	Login security is taking longer due to learning authentication setup.
7. Summary
The project is moving forward with most backend work done and user frontend complete. I’m working on security and other frontends to finish soon.
